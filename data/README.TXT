What's Stars! all about?
-----------------------------------------------------
Stars! is the only full-blown interstellar strategy game for Microsoft
Windows that's fast-paced and simple to play while allowing you to carry out
complex and clever strategies. You'll build starships, discover and colonize
new planets, research new technologies, manage the essential elements of
world economies, defend your empire and (no guarantees here) destroy all
your enemies. One or more people can play, on a single machine, across a
network, over modems, email or computer bulletin boards.  Complex computer
players are available for both single and multi player games.

A tutorial and an extensive help file will get you up to speed in no time.
To begin the tutorial, start Stars!, press the New Game button and select
Begin Tutorial.

=====================================================
How do I setup Stars!?
-----------------------------------------------------
Place STARS!.EXE and STARS!.HLP in the same directory.  Run STARS!.EXE
for both single and multi-player games.  Create a Program Manage icon
for STARS!.EXE and you're ready to go.

The file COMMDLG.DLL has been provided in case you do not already have
one installed in your \windows\system directory.  If you do not have
COMMDLG.DLL installed, you may experience problems trying to open and
save Stars! games.  Copy this file to your \windows\system directory
to rectify these problems.
